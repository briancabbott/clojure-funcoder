### Clojure-funcoder
A place to identify core Clojure features and functionality and build code
implementing that functionality. 

### Social Blends


### MBOX-Extractor
this is really to get at some programming problem practice data I have in my
Google Takeouts. But, it will be cool in its own right. As far as I can tell,
there aren't any useful utilities for managing Google GMail MBOX exports via
the CLI.


### CloJars-Analizer


### GitHub-Repository-Downloader


### macOS-system-projects
(experimental for a Clojure => C/C++/Obj-C/Swift bridge (direct))


### Data-Datomic


### Xtrax
