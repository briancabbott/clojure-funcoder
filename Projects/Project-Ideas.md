# Clojure Funcoder Project Ideas to code up
   - Social Blends
   - MBOX-Extractor
   - CloJars-Analizer

Additional projects to incorporate into clojure-funcoder, standalone projects but, within
the goal/idea of a solid Clojure portfolio/learning/and trying space that's consolidated
as one effort.
   - GitHub-Repository-Downloader
   - macOS-system-projects (experimental for a Clojure => C/C++/Obj-C/Swift bridge (direct))


## Social-Blends


## MBOX-Extractor
  - this is really to get at some programming problem practice data I have in my
    Google Takeouts. But, it will be cool in its own right. As far as I can tell,
    there aren't any useful utilities for managing Google GMail MBOX exports via
    the CLI.
